Clean code is readable, but it must also be robust. These are not conflicting goals. We can
write robust clean code if we see error handling as a separate concern, something that is
viewable independently of our main logic. To the degree that we are able to do that, we can
reason about it independently, and we can make great strides in the maintainability of our
code.
