We have barely scratched the surface of this topic. Indeed, I think an entire book could be
written about clean tests. Tests are as important to the health of a project as the production
code is. Perhaps they are even more important, because tests preserve and enhance the
flexibility, maintainability, and reusability of the production code. So keep your tests con-
stantly clean. Work to make them expressive and succinct. Invent testing APIs that act as
domain-specific language that helps you write the tests.

If you let the tests rot, then your code will rot too. Keep your tests clean.
