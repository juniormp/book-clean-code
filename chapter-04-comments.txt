Nothing can be quite so helpful as a well-placed comment. Nothing can clutter up a mod-
ule more than frivolous dogmatic comments. Nothing can be quite so damaging as an old
crufty comment that propagates lies and misinformation.

Comments are not like Schindler’s List. They are not “pure good.” Indeed, comments
are, at best, a necessary evil. If our programming languages were expressive enough, or if
we had the talent to subtly wield those languages to express our intent, we would not need
comments very much—perhaps not at all.

The proper use of comments is to compensate for our failure to express ourself in
code. Note that I used the word failure. I meant it. Comments are always failures. We must
have them because we cannot always figure out how to express ourselves without them,
but their use is not a cause for celebration.
