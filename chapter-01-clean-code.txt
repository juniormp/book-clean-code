Books on art don’t promise to make you an artist. All they can do is give you some of the
tools, techniques, and thought processes that other artists have used. So too this book can-
not promise to make you a good programmer. It cannot promise to give you “code-sense.”

All it can do is show you the thought processes of good programmers and the tricks, tech-
niques, and tools that they use.

Just like a book on art, this book will be full of details. There will be lots of code.
You’ll see good code and you’ll see bad code. You’ll see bad code transformed into good
code. You’ll see lists of heuristics, disciplines, and techniques. You’ll see example after
example. After that, it’s up to you.

Remember the old joke about the concert violinist who got lost on his way to a perfor-
mance? He stopped an old man on the corner and asked him how to get to Carnegie Hall.
The old man looked at the violinist and the violin tucked under his arm, and said: “Prac-
tice, son. Practice!”
